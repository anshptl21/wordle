         Upon his death, he had no line succession to heed his vast empire, which resulted in his generals fighting for the remains of his empire. Eventually, the generals separated the region into several kingdoms. This caused 
         Greek culture to spread far and wide changing the course of history for many countries and drastically impacting Greeks and their culture.

            With the separation of a centralized empire to decentralized independent kingdoms came a power struggle between the kingdoms and rising powers in Rome. With the kingdoms
            relying only upon themselves to defend their land, there were looming threats of war with a new conqueror in Italy, Gaius Julius Cesear Augustus. He was the first emperor of the Roman Empire from 27 BC to 14 AD. 
            He led the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. He defeated Cloepatra and Mark Anthony's armies in the Battle of Actium resulting in the siege of Egypt, ending the Hellenistic period and giving way to Roman Empire.

            immediate diversification of the amount of people living a Greek-speaking world. 
            From Egypt to India, the values of the society changed drastically to match those of the Ancient Greeks. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Ancient Greeks valued:
            <br>
            <br> 
            <li>Honor</li>
            <li>Academia</li>

            <li>Sports</li>
            <li>Individualism</li>
            <br>
            They had a desire to understand the diversity within their empire while trying to understand the world around them. 
            They encouraged education and the usage of math and science to further society and military progress. 
            <br>
            However, their emphasis of warfare resulted in many trying to find a sense of purpose by forming cults to seek freedom in ways religion had not. The warfare they seen
            from Alexender the Great's ruthless conquering and absolute monarchy forced many to go down this route.

               <br>
               <br>
               A summary of the Ancient Greek Religion:
               <br>
               <br>
               <li>The Ancient Greeks follows a polytheistic religion. The gods were involved in several aspects of human life 
                  and describe the world around them explaining the rituals and traditions they practice to the weather and foods they have. </li>
               <li>These gods were 
               known as The Olympian Gods and these gods are seen in many famous literature such as The Odyssey.</li>
               <li>The main three gods are called Zeus, king of Gods, Poseidon, ruler of the sea, and Hades, ruler of the Underworld</li>
               <li>The religion heavily infused myths which described the relationship between Gods and man along with explaining how these gods control the world around them.</li>
               <li>The ancient Greeks had rituals to honor the Gods. This included honoring the gods in temples, animal sacrifices made at altars, and more.</li>
               <br>
               Contributions of The Hellenistic Period to religion:

               <br>
               <li>Hellenistic Judasim: Jewish people that lived in the Macadonian Empire adopted Greek religion and cultures</li>
               <li>Dualism: People  wanted to escape from the absolute power by the government. 
                  They sought to extend to another world, the Beyond, to seek freedom.
               </li>
               <li>Cults: With greater access to more regions combined with war and monarchy, people began to form cults to 
                  find purpose and seek freedom
               </li>
               <li>Dieties: Due to the vast size of the Macadonian Empire, dieties from other countries, such as Egypt, were introduced to Greece</li>
